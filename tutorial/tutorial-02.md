### Tutorial Part 2 - Setting Up Your Project

1. Since we're using Bitnami as our local development stack, we need to create a directory for our project files in a place where Bitnami's web server can find them.
	1. In a terminal window, change into the directory where Bitnami will look for your project files.
		1. `$ cd /your-bitnami-installation-directory/apache2/htdocs`
			1. On a Mac, this directory will likely be `/Applications/mampstack-7.1.7-0/apache2/htdocs`
	2. Create a directory for your project files.
		1. `$ mkdir wms_users_2017`
	3. Change into the directory you just created.
		1. `$ cd wms_users_2017`

**Once you've created your project directory, move on to [Tutorial Part 3](tutorial-03.md).**
